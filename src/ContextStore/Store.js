Fry boasts fewer comic spikes than Jonasson’s 100 year-old man but is no less eccentric, his story just as strangely believable an anecdote of very human quirk. Joyce’s ponderous words find happy union in the thoughtful eye of Hettie Macdonald, one half of the directing duo behind lockdown hit Normal People, and lush cinematography of Kate McCullough. The plotting is somber and steady but offers much welcome breathing space to appreciate the minutiae of English beauty, town and country alike...",

As things stand, Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck are out, while Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa sit patiently on the bench. Robert Pattinson and Joaquin Phoenix, by contrast, enjoy a league of their own. When it comes to Shazam, the judge’s gavel has yet to fall and there’s little optimism in the jury. It would be a shame if Fury of the Gods marked the final bow for Zachary Levi’s lovably insecure supe but the battle for retention won’t be easy.

    description: "Elon Musk has often accused OpenAI's ChatGPT of being 'too woke' and never really shies away from criticising the AI chatbot. So when Musk's own chatbot, GrokAI, came to town, comparisons started happening. A Twitter (now called X) user took to the platform and compared Grok with ChatGPT, saying that the former is also as woke as the latter. Responding to the user, Musk said that the internet on which GrokAI has been trained is woke and that he promises that the chatbot will get better with time.",
